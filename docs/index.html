            <h3>Cantor Set Proof</h3>
            <p>
                <br> 
                My proof addresses the claim: <strong>"The Cantor set is compact and equal to the set of its cluster points."</strong><br>
                <br> 
        
                This proof seeks to go beyond standard explanations of this claim by eliminating logical jumps and ensuring all claims are rigorously justified.<br>
                That is, many proofs of this result rely on statements that are left unexplained or are considered "trivially true," which I sought to avoid entirely.<br>
                <br> 
                The Cantor set is an interesting mathematical construct that, despite being uncountably infinite (having a cardinality equal to that of the real numbers), possesses a Lebesgue measure of zero, meaning it occupies no length on the number line. This paradoxical natureâ€”being vast in terms of cardinality yet negligible in measureâ€”offers profound insights into set theory and the concept of infinity.<br>
                <br> 
                In less mathematical terms, this claim states that the Cantor set is both well-contained within finite boundaries and made up entirely of points that are "densely surrounded" by others, even as we zoom infinitely into its structure.<br>
                <br> 
                Key terms explained in the proof include:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Cantor set:</strong> The Cantor set is constructed by iteratively removing the open middle third from each interval segment. Starting with the closed interval [0, 1], the open middle third (1/3, 2/3) is removed, leaving two segments: [0, 1/3] and [2/3, 1]. This process is repeated for each remaining segment, continually removing the open middle third from each. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set" target="_blank">[Wikipedia]</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Compactness:</strong> A set is compact if every collection of open sets that covers the set has a finite subcollection that also covers it. In Euclidean spaces, compactness is equivalent to being both closed (containing all its limit points) and bounded (fitting within a finite region). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space" target="_blank">[Wikipedia]</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Cluster points:</strong> Points for which every neighborhood (region around a point) contains infinitely many points of the set. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulation_point" target="_blank">[Wikipedia]</a></li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Turing Machines</h3>

        <div class = "project">
            
            <strong> the following sections are Turing Machines that I designed and Implemented!</strong>
            <br> 
            <br> 

            <p>
                A <strong>Turing machine</strong> is a theoretical computational model that manipulates symbols on an infinite tape according to a set of rules. It serves as a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, helping to define the limits of what can be computed. 
                
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Key Components:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Tape:</strong> An infinite memory divided into discrete cells, each capable of holding a symbol from a finite alphabet.</li>
                <li><strong>Head:</strong> A read/write mechanism that moves across the tape, reading symbols and writing new ones based on the machine's rules.</li>
                <li><strong>State Register:</strong> Stores the current state of the Turing machine, chosen from a finite set of states.</li>
                <li><strong>Transition Function:</strong> Defines the machine's actions (write a symbol, move the head, change state) based on the current state and the symbol being read.</li>
              </ul>

              <br> 
            
              
              <p>The Turing Machines I have implemented can be categorized into two types:</p>

              <h3>How to use and interpret the below simulations </h3>
              <br>

              In the below Turing Machine simulators, you can input a string that serves as the initial content of the Turing machine's tape.
              <br><br> The simulation processes this input step by step, displaying the tape's content and the position of the read/write head at each stage. 
              
              <br> <br>The symbol ^ indicates the current position of the head, allowing you to observe how the machine reads, writes, and moves across the tape during its computation.
